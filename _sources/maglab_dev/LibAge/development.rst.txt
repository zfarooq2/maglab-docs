LibAge
======

Development
-----------

Software
^^^^^^^^

LibAge uses the Python and Django stack.

Setting up
^^^^^^^^^^

See information of setting up with Python Django.

Branches
^^^^^^^^

For major development work it is generally better to start a new branch and merge when required. 

For non-breaking work, like typos and minor bugs, making the changes directly to master is fine.
