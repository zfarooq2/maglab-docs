HAGR
====

Development
-----------

Software
^^^^^^^^

HAGR is based on PHP, it doesn't use a web framework or any particularly strict design pattern. 

The backend database is MySQL, of which there is a database for each resource e.g. GenAge, GenDR, DrugAge, etc.

IDE
^^^

I have been using LiClipse for development for HAGR and any DAA changes as I thought it may work better with Python, although Eclipse is a good option.

Setting up
^^^^^^^^^^

.. warning::
   All HTML files are treated as PHP files by the server. This is to allow inclusion of header and footer files to simplify development while still maintaining backwards compatibility with old URL's. This is defined in a .htaccess file in the root directory.
    
Setting up HAGR for a local deployment is easy. You simply download from git and set it up with a PHP based webserver (such as Apache) on your local system.

Each HAGR database (e.g. GenAge) has a separate MySQL database behind it. Simply download and set up each one. You may need to change the configuration in ``/functions/db_config.php`` to point to the correct databases.

Database
^^^^^^^^

The database is MySQL, which will need exporting from the beta version of HAGR on the maglab server. The Live HAGR data is only accessible by Pedro.

Branches
^^^^^^^^

For major development work it is generally better to start a new branch and merge when required. For non-breaking work, like typos and minor bugs, making the changes directly to master is fine. Make sure that you pull before doing major work as Pedro contributes heavily towards the sites.
