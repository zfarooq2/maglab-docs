Genome and Transcriptome Resources
===================================

This page covers development of Naked Mole rat, Bowhead Whale and Ocean Clam genome and transcriptome resources. 

They are all very similar in terms of architecture, using Python Django and templating to server the HTML content. 

Each also includes it's own BLAST installation for searching user entered sequences against the data.

Development

Software
^^^^^^^^

The genome resources are a result of sequencing projects the lab has been involved with other institutions, resulting in portals to present the data 

They all use Python Django with PostgreSQL.
