HAGR Development
===============

Software
^^^^^^^^

HAGR is built using PHP, it doesn't use a web framework or any particularly strict design pattern. The backend database is MySQL, of which there is a database for each resource e.g. GenAge, GenDR, DrugAge, etc.

IDE
^^^

I have been using LiClipse for development, of HAGR and any DAA changes as I thought it may work better with Python, although Eclipse is a good option.

Setup
^^^^^

Setting up a project to run the PHP code is pretty straight forward using Eclipse or other IDEs. 

You will also need to then setup Apache locally to serve the pages.
